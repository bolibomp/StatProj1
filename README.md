The two point correlation function, ω(θ), is used for description of data clusters, such as
galaxy distribution. Clustering increase the likelihood that two points are close to each
other and ω(θ) determines a probability dP to find two objects on an angle θ from each
other within two solid angle elements dΩ1 and dΩ2
